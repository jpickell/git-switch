***git-switch***
----
Simple script to easily switch between git remote urls.

- Will initialize a directory if it hasn't already been set up.  
- Like to re-write from perl to python
- Figure out a way to be able to trigger a push on a clean repo 
-- ie. Just commited and pushed, switched the url; git push doesn't see any changes to sync (maybe handle with a .active file that always shows the current url, so it would change when the url is updated)
- Move the config to .git-switch config file instead of keeping it in the script
