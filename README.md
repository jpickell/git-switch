***git-switch***
----
Simple script to easily switch between git remote urls.

- Will initialize a directory if it hasn't already been set up.  
- Updates the final line of the README with a "Last Updated: $date" line to allow for immediate add,comment & push to the new remote url.
- I would like to eventually re-write this from perl to python
- Move the config to .git-switch config file instead of keeping it in the script
